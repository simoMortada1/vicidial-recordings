# vicidial-recordings

New and modern looking interface to access vicidial recordings. 

Access recordings.php with your browsers after updating your dbConfig.php file (put in your asterisk database information)

Vicidial is an open source dialer & contact center solution that is around for more than 20 years now (http://www.vicidial.org)

For this specific development we did use the following open source libraries: 

w3css CSS library: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css

FontAwsome: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css

jquery: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js

dataTables: http://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.24/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js & https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.24/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css"

Code is free of charge. You can use it to improve your daily operations of vicidial.
